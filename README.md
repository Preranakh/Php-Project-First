This the project created using php and mysql

This is a website which helps in the recruitment process by bringing together both the employer and the job seeking candidate. The candidate will have to create his profile by uploading his resume which will be then viewed by the company and employer as and when there is any opening. It is a simplified process of job hunting.
The web application is developed by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery for the user interface (UI) design; core PHP for the working of the application and Wampp/Xampp web server.
